# SpaceTerm

SpaceTerm is a roguelike game set in space. As with all space trading games your objective is to become rich in a universe that is basically trying to kill you. To make things more complicated, as with all roguelikes, death is permanent, so play carefully!

## Installation

Just clone the repository an run:

```bash
./main.py
```

note that Python v3.x is required.

## Controls

Like any roguelike controls are:

| Key   | Action               |
|:-----:|----------------------|
| k     | up (x axis)          |
| j     | down (x axis)        |
| h     | left                 |
| l     | right                |

| u     | up-right (x axis)    |
| b     | bottom-left (x axis) |
| n     | bottom-right (x axis)|
| .     | skip turn            |

| <     | lower (z axis)       |

## Screenshots

The game is in its early stages. This screenshot shows a mockup of the sector ui, the player spaceship (@) and a couple of solar systems represented by a colored S. The color matches the class of the main star of the solar system.
